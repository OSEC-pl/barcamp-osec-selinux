[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     The [1mbozohttpd [22mprogram reads a [4mHTTP[24m request from the standard input, and
     sends a reply to the standard output.  Besides ~user translation and vir‚Äê
     tual hosting support (see below), all file requests are from [4mslashdir[0m
     directory.  The server uses [4mmyname[24m as its name, which defaults to the
     local hostname, obtained from gethostname(3) (but see the [1m-v [22moption for
     virtual hosting.)  [1mbozohttpd [22mwrites logs to syslog(3) using the ftp
     facility (but see the [1m-s [22moption for testing.)  [1mbozohttpd [22mis designed to
     be small, simple and relatively featureless, hopefully increasing its
     security.

   [1mOPTIONS[0m
     The following options are available:

     [1m-b         [22mEnables daemon mode, where [1mbozohttpd [22mdetaches from the current
                terminal, running in the background and servicing HTTP
                requests.

     [1m-C [4m[22msuffix[24m [4mcgihandler[0m
                Adds a new CGI handler program for a particular file type.
                The [4msuffix[24m should be any normal file suffix, and the
                [4mcgihandler[24m should be a full path to an interpreter.  This
                option is the only way to enable CGI programs that exist out‚Äê
                side of the cgibin directory to be executed.  Multiple [1m-C[0m
                options may be passed.

     [1m-c [4m[22mcgibin[24m  Enables the CGI/1.1 interface.  The [4mcgibin[24m directory is
                expected to contain the CGI programs to be used.  [1mbozohttpd[0m
                looks for URL's in the form of [4m/cgi-bin/<scriptname>[24m where
                ‚ü®scriptname‚ü© is a valid CGI program in the [4mcgibin[24m directory.
                In other words, all CGI URL's must begin with [4m/cgi-bin/[24m.  Note
                that the CGI/1.1 interface is available with [4m~user[24m translation
                using [1m-E [22mswitch.

     [1m-e         [22mCauses [1mbozohttpd [22mto not clear the environment when used with
                either the [1m-t [22mor [1m-U [22moptions.

     [1m-f         [22mStops the [1m-b [22mflag from [1mbozohttpd [22mdetaching from the tty and
                going into the background.

     [1m-G         [22mGet the [1mbozohttpd [22mversion string, print it on standard output,
                and exit.

     [1m-H         [22mCauses directory index mode to hide files and directories that
                start with a period, except for [4m..[24m.  Also see [1m-X[22m.

     [1m-I [4m[22mport[24m    Causes [1mbozohttpd [22mto use [4mport[24m instead of the default ‚Äúhttp‚Äù
                port.  When used with the [1m-b [22moption, it changes the bound
                port.  Otherwise it forces redirections to use this port
                instead of the value obtained via getsockname(2).

     [1m-i [4m[22maddress[0m
                Causes [4maddress[24m to be used as the address to bind daemon mode.
                If otherwise unspecified, the address used to bind is derived
                from the [4mmyname[24m, which defaults to the name returned by
                gethostname(3).  Only the last [1m-i [22moption is used.  This option
                is only valid with the [1m-b [22moption.

     [1m-L [4m[22mprefix[24m [4mscript[0m
                Adds a new Lua script for a particular prefix.  The [4mprefix[0m
                should be an arbitrary text, and the [4mscript[24m should be a full
                path to a Lua script.  Multiple [1m-L [22moptions may be passed.  A
                separate Lua state is created for each prefix.  The Lua script
                can register callbacks using the httpd.register_han‚Äê
                dler('<name>', function) Lua function, which will trigger the
                execution of the Lua function [4mfunction[24m when a URL in the form
                [4mhttp://<hostname>/<prefix>/<name>[24m is being accessed.  The
                function is passed three tables as arguments, the server envi‚Äê
                ronment, the request headers, and the decoded query string
                plus any data that was sent as application/x-www-form-urlen‚Äê
                coded.

     [1m-M [4m[22msuffix[24m [4mtype[24m [4mencoding[24m [4mencoding11[0m
                Adds a new entry to the table that converts file suffixes to
                content type and encoding.  This option takes four additional
                arguments containing the file prefix, its ‚ÄúContent-Type‚Äù,
                ‚ÄúContent-Encoding‚Äù, and ‚ÄúContent-Encoding‚Äù for HTTP/1.1 con‚Äê
                nections, respectively.  If any of these are a single dash
                (‚Äú-‚Äù), the empty string is used instead.  Multiple [1m-M [22moptions
                may be passed.

     [1m-n         [22mStops [1mbozohttpd [22mfrom doing IP address to name resolution of
                hosts for setting the REMOTE_HOST variable before running a
                CGI program.  This option has no effect without the [1m-c [22moption.

     [1m-P [4m[22mpidfile[0m
                Causes [1mbozohttpd [22mto create a pid file in [4mpidfile[24m when run in
                daemon mode with the [1m-b [22moption.

     [1m-p [4m[22mpubdir[24m  Changes the default user directory for [4m/~user/[24m translations
                from ‚Äúpublic_html‚Äù to [4mpubdir[24m.

     [1m-S [4m[22mserver_software[0m
                Sets the internal server version to [4mserver_software[24m.

     [1m-s         [22mForces logging to be set to stderr always.

     [1m-t [4m[22mchrootdir[0m
                Makes [1mbozohttpd [22mchroot to the specified directory before
                answering requests.  Every other path should be specified rel‚Äê
                ative to the new root, if this option is used.  Note that the
                current environment is normally replaced with an empty envi‚Äê
                ronment with this option, unless the [1m-e [22moption is also used.

     [1m-U [4m[22musername[0m
                Causes [1mbozohttpd [22mto switch to the user and the groups of
                [4musername[24m after initialization.  This option, like [1m-t [22mabove,
                causes [1mbozohttpd [22mto clear the environment unless the [1m-e [22moption
                is given.

     [1m-u         [22mEnables the transformation of Uniform Resource Locators of the
                form [4m/~user/[24m into the directory [4m~user/public_html[24m (but see the
                [1m-p [22moption above).

     [1m-E         [22mEnables CGI/1.1 interface for [4m~user[24m translation.  Note that
                enabling this support implies that users can run commands as
                web server user, this may have security implications.

     [1m-V         [22mSets the backup virtual host directory to the [4mslashdir[24m argu‚Äê
                ment.  If no directory exists in [4mvirtualroot[24m for the request,
                then [4mslashdir[24m will be used.  The default behaviour is to
                return 404 (Not Found.)

     [1m-v [4m[22mvirtualroot[0m
                Enables virtual hosting support.  Directories in [4mvirtualroot[0m
                will be searched for a matching virtual host name, when pars‚Äê
                ing the HTML request.  If a matching name is found, it will be
                used as both the server's real name, [[4mmyname[24m], and as the
                [4mslashdir[24m.  See the [4mEXAMPLES[24m section for an example of using
                this option.

     [1m-X         [22mEnables directory indexing.  A directory index will be gener‚Äê
                ated only when the default file (i.e.  [4mindex.html[24m normally) is
                not present.

     [1m-x [4m[22mindex[24m   Changes the default file read for directories from
                ‚Äúindex.html‚Äù to [4mindex[24m.

     [1m-z [4m[22mciphers[0m
                Sets the list of SSL ciphers (see SSL_CTX_set_cipher_list(3)).

     [1m-Z [4m[22mcertificate_path[24m [4mprivatekey_path[0m
                Sets the path to the server certificate file and the private
                key file in pem format.  It also causes [1mbozohttpd [22mto start SSL
                mode.

     Note that in [1mbozohttpd [22mversions 20031005 and prior that supported the [1m-C[0m
     and [1m-M [22moptions, they took a single space-separated argument that was
     parsed.  since version 20040828, they take multiple options (2 in the
     case of [1m-C [22mand 4 in the case of [1m-M[22m.)

   [1mINETD CONFIGURATION[0m
     As [1mbozohttpd [22muses inetd(8) by default to process incoming TCP connections
     for HTTP requests (but see the [1m-b [22moption), [1mbozohttpd [22mhas little internal
     networking knowledge.  (Indeed, you can run it on the command line with
     little change of functionality.)  A typical inetd.conf(5) entry would be:

     http stream tcp  nowait:600 _httpd /usr/libexec/httpd httpd /var/www
     http stream tcp6 nowait:600 _httpd /usr/libexec/httpd httpd /var/www

     This would serve web pages from [4m/var/www[24m on both IPv4 and IPv6 ports.
     The [4m:600[24m changes the requests per minute to 600, up from the inetd(8)
     default of 40.

     Using the NetBSD inetd(8), you can provide multiple IP-address based HTTP
     servers by having multiple listening ports with different configurations.

   [1mNOTES[0m
     This server supports the [4mHTTP/0.9[24m, [4mHTTP/1.0[24m, and [4mHTTP/1.1[24m standards.
     Support for these protocols is very minimal and many optional features
     are not supported.

     [1mbozohttpd [22mcan be compiled without CGI support (NO_CGIBIN_SUPPORT), user
     transformations (NO_USER_SUPPORT), directory index support
     (NO_DIRINDEX_SUPPORT), daemon mode support (NO_DAEMON_MODE), dynamic MIME
     content (NO_DYNAMIC_CONTENT), Lua support (NO_LUA_SUPPORT), and SSL sup‚Äê
     port (NO_SSL_SUPPORT) by defining the listed macros when building
     [1mbozohttpd[22m.

   [1mHTTP BASIC AUTHORISATION[0m
     [1mbozohttpd [22mhas support for HTTP Basic Authorisation.  If a file named
     [4m.htpasswd[24m exists in the directory of the current request, [1mbozohttpd [22mwill
     restrict access to documents in that directory using the RFC 2617 HTTP
     ‚ÄúBasic‚Äù authentication scheme.

     Note: This does not recursively protect any sub-directories.

     The [4m.htpasswd[24m file contains lines delimited with a colon containing user‚Äê
     names and passwords hashed with crypt(3), for example:

     heather:$1$pZWI4tH/$DzDPl63i6VvVRv2lJNV7k1
     jeremy:A.xewbx2DpQ8I

     On NetBSD, the pwhash(1) utility may be used to generate hashed pass‚Äê
     words.

     While [1mbozohttpd [22mdistributed with NetBSD has support for HTTP Basic Autho‚Äê
     risation enabled by default, in the portable distribution it is excluded.
     Compile [1mbozohttpd [22mwith ‚Äú-DDO_HTPASSWD‚Äù on the compiler command line to
     enable this support.  It may require linking with the crypt library,
     using ‚Äú-lcrypt‚Äù.

   [1mSSL SUPPORT[0m
     [1mbozohttpd [22mhas support for TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 protocols that are included
     by default.  It requires linking with the crypto and ssl library, using
     ‚Äú-lcrypto -lssl‚Äù.  To disable SSL SUPPORT compile [1mbozohttpd [22mwith
     ‚Äú-DNO_SSL_SUPPORT‚Äù on the compiler command line.

   [1mCOMPRESSION[0m
     [1mbozohttpd [22msupports a very basic form of compression.  [1mbozohttpd [22mwill
     serve the requested file postpended with ‚Äú[4m.gz[24m‚Äù if it exists, it is read‚Äê
     able, the client requested gzip compression, and the client did not make
     a ranged request.

[1mFILES[0m
     [1mbozohttpd [22mlooks for a couple of special files in directories that allow
     certain features to be provided on a per-directory basis.  In addition to
     the [4m.htpasswd[24m used by HTTP basic authorisation, if a [4m.bzdirect[24m file is
     found (contents are irrelevant) [1mbozohttpd [22mwill allow direct access even
     with the [1m-r [22moption.  If a [4m.bzredirect[24m symbolic link is found, [1mbozohttpd[0m
     will perform a smart redirect to the target of this symlink.  The target
     is assumed to live on the same server.  If target starts with slash then
     absolute redirection is performed, otherwise it's handled as relative.
     If a [4m.bzabsredirect[24m symbolic link is found, [1mbozohttpd [22mwill redirect to
     the absolute url pointed to by this symlink.  This is useful to redirect
     to different servers.  Two forms of redirection are supported - symbolic
     link without schema will use [4mhttp://[24m as default i.e. link to [4mNetBSD.org[0m
     will redirect to [4mhttp://NetBSD.org/[24m Otherwise provided schema will be
     used i.e. symbolic link to [4mftp://NetBSD.org/[24m will redirect to provided
     the URL.

[1mEXAMPLES[0m
     To configure set of virtual hosts, one would use an inetd.conf(5) entry
     like:

     http stream tcp  nowait:600 _httpd /usr/libexec/httpd httpd -v /var/vroot /var/www

     and inside [4m/var/vroot[24m create a directory (or a symlink to a directory)
     with the same name as the virtual host, for each virtual host.  Lookups
     for these names are done in a case-insensitive manner, and may include
     the port number part of the request, allowing for distinct virtual hosts
     on the same name.

     To use [1mbozohttpd [22mwith PHP, one must use the [1m-C [22moption to specify a CGI
     handler for a particular file type.  Typically this will be like:

     httpd -C .php /usr/pkg/bin/php-cgi /var/www

[1mSEE ALSO[0m
     inetd.conf(5), inetd(8)

[1mHISTORY[0m
     [1mbozohttpd [22mwas first written in perl, based on another perl http server
     called ‚Äútinyhttpd‚Äù.  It was then rewritten from scratch in perl, and then
     once again in C.  From ‚Äúbozohttpd‚Äù version 20060517, it has been inte‚Äê
     grated into NetBSD.  The focus has always been simplicity and security,
     with minimal features and regular code audits.  This manual documents
     [1mbozohttpd [22mversion 20170201.
